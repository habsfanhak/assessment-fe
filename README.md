This is the front-end for the STIKBOOK coding assessment. Live deployment at https://assessment-fe-zeta.vercel.app/

After cloning, you may run the following commands.

You can run 'npm i' to install all required packages.

```npm i```

By default when running locally the API_URL is defined as localhost:8080, so ensure the back-end is up and running before you proceed.

Then run 'npm run dev' to start the server at port 3000.

```npm run dev```
